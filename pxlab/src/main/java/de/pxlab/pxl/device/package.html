<p>Support for external devices. 

<p>This package provides support for external devices which need
extension of the Java Runtime Environment for communication and
sometimes also need proprietary interface support software.

<p>Currently the following devices are supported:

<ul>

<li>The GretagMacbeth EyeOne colorimeter. This needs the GretagMacbeth
EyeOne SDK library for USB support.

<li>The Tektronix Lumacolor II with J1810 colorimeter head. This is
connected to the system using a serial communication port (RS232) and
requires the installation of the <a
href="http://java.sun.com/products/javacomm/index.html">Java
Communications API</a>.

<li>Other devices connected to the system via the serial communication
port (RS232) and also require the installation of the <a
href="http://java.sun.com/products/javacomm/index.html">Java
Communications API</a>.

</ul>
