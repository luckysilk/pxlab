<p>Statistical support classes which are not necessarily needed by the PXLab
experimental runtime core methods.

<p>Some statistical analysis methods of this package use the class
<class>FactorialDataTable</class> as its data. This is a table of
factor level combinations and dependent variables.  The factorial data
table is a <class>HashMap</class> of double values. The data values
are the last entries of each input line with the respective factor
level combination being the key for the <class>HashMap</class>. If a
single factor level combination appears more than once in the input
data then its data value becomes the arithmetic mean value over all
replications.

<p>A <class>FactorialFrequencyDataTable</class> is a subclass of the
<class>FactorialDataTable</class> which contains frequencies as its dependent
variables.

<p>A <class>FactorialDataTable</class> may be created from a
<class>StringDataTable</class> which actually reflects the data as they
are collected in a PXLab experiment. A string data table is organized as
an <class>ArrayList</class> of <class>String</class> arrays. Each
string array contains one unit of input data usually those which have
been created by a single trial.

<p>The computational work is done by the subclasses of
<class>StatEngine</class> which may be used from within a PXLab design
file with the application de.pxlab.pxl.run.ExStat or from a local
application which does some dedicated statistical analysis and does
not expect a structured PXLab data file, but can use any data file
organized int one line of input for every trial.
  
<p>This package contains the following local applications which are
subclasses of <class>StatCommand</class> and can be used to compute
some dedicated statistics:

<dl>

<dt>Anova<dd>computes an analysis of variance.

<dt>PMF<dd>estimates parameters of a psychometric function.

<dt>Regression<dd>computes linear multiple regression.

<dt>Statistics<dd>computes lots of descriptive statistics.
