<h2>PXLab Vision Demonstrations Help</h2>

The main frame shows two subpanels: The right panel always contains a
demo display while the left panel contains a color, geometry or timing
control panel. Switching between these control panels is done by
pressing the respective button in the tool bar immediately below the
main menu bar. Demonstrations are selected from the main menu bar's
Select menu.


<h3>The Color Control Panel</h3>

<p>The color control panel is used to adjust the <b>currently active
color parameter</b>. The currently active color parameter may be set
by two different methods:<br>(1) by selecting any of the object areas
such that the color parameter defining this area's color will become
the currently active color parameter, or<br>(2) by selecting the
respective color at the bottom of the color control panel which shows
the colors of all adjustable color parameters of the current demo
display.

<p>Colors are adjusted by pointing into a chromaticity chart or by
adjusting color coordinate sliders. <b>Coordinates may only be set
such that the resulting color is actually displayable on the current display
device.</b>

<h4>The Chromaticity Charts</h4>

<p>The color control panel can show any of the following color systems:

<ul> <li>CIE 1931 xy-chromaticity chart with luminance,

<li>CIE 1976 L*a*b*-color space, 

<li>CIE 1976 L*u*v*-color space,

<li>CIE 1997 Color Appearance Model (CIECAM97s),

<li>The Boynton & MacLeod relative cone excitation space with
luminance, 

<li>CIE 1931 XYZ-sliders, 

<li>linear RGB relative luminance sliders,

<li>device RGB values.  </ul>

<p>Selection between these color systems is done by pressing the
respective button on top of the color control panel.

<p>Chromaticity charts are shown in a 2D-chart with a separate
luminance control slider. Each chart also contains a marked region
indicating those chromaticity values which are displayable by the
current output device at the currently defined luminance
level. The currently active color may be adjusted by pressing the left
mouse button and moving the cursor within the valid color
region. Depending on the state of the <em>Follow invalid colors</em> flag it
is also possible to move outside the currently valid color region as
long as the target chromaticity can be displayed at a lower luminance
level. 

<p>3D-values are shown as 3 sliders. Note that the XYZ-sliders are
hard to use since only displayable colors may be set and the slider
version of the color control panel does not have a visible rangle
control.

<h4>Numerical Coordinates</h4>

<p>Numerical values for any of the above listed color systems may be
shown in the bottom region of the color control panel. 
It also is possible to directly enter numerical values into the
respective text entry fields.  

<p>To add/remove a numerical color coordinates field to the color control
panel open the <em>Options</em> menu on the main menu bar, select the
options subgroup <em>Color</em> and open the submenu <em>Numerical
coordinates fields</em>. Add or remove a coordinate system by
activating or clearing the respective flag.

<h4>The Color Board</h4>

The system maintains a color board where color values may be stored
for later use. The content of the color board is shown below the
numerical coordinates fields and above the series of current color
parameters.

<p>To push a color onto the color board press the right mouse button
within the demo display area and then select <em>Copy to color board</em>
from the popup menu. This copies the color of the currently active
color parameter to the color board.

<p>To set the currently active color parameter to the last color of
the color board use the <em>Paste from color board</em> entry of the display
area's popup menu. This also removes the color from the color board.

<p>To set the currently active color parameter to any color contained
in the color board simply press the left mouse button on top of the
respective field of the color board. This does not remove the color
from the color board.

<p>To enable/disable showing the colors currently contained in the
color board within the color chart open the <em>Options</em> menu on the
main menu bar, select options subgroup <em>Color</em> and modify the
flag <em>Show color board in charts</em>.

  


<h3>The Geometry Control Panel</h3>

<p>This panel shows all those parameters of a display object which
control geometric properties. Depending on the type of parameter the
geometry control panel provides different tools to modify parameter
values. Numerical parameters have sliders and text value controls,
string parameters have text control fields, and binary flags have
switches. Parameters which are only allowed to assume a finite number
of integer control codes have these codes listed for selection
together with their labels.


<h3>The Timing Control Panel</h3>

<p>This panel shows all those parameters of a display object which
control timing properties. Control tools are identicl to those of the
geometry control panel.

<p>Note, however, that most timing properties are only relevant during
real time experimental runs and are not used in display demonstration
mode.


<h3>Timing Groups</h3>

Display objects are made up of simpler geometric objects. These may be
grouped together to create timing groups. A single timing group
contains only geometric primitives which are simultanously
visible. The number of timing groups in a display is indicated by the
small numbered buttons in the tool bar button line. The numbered
button series is always preceded by a single button marked
<em>x</em>. Pressing this button results in showing all timing groups
simultanously. Pressing any of the numbered buttons tells the display
system to only show those elements of the display which belong to the
respective timing group. Note that a single display element my belong
to more than a single timing group.


<h3>Animated Displays</h3>

If a display includes animation then the <em>Animate</em>-button will
be active. Pressing this button starts animation and pressing the same
button again stops it.

<h3>Full Screen Display</h3>

The button <em>Full</em> in the button tool bar shows the display in
full screen mode without any controls. Any mouse button press in full
screen mode will force the display back to window mode.

<h3>Gamma Parameter Computation</h3>

After the test fields of the gamma parameter displays (Select: Display
Testing: Visual Gamma Function Measurement) have been adjusted the
system can compute gamma parameters for the current display device.
To compute gamma parameters open the <em>Options</em> menu on the main
menu bar, select options subgroup <em>Color</em> and activate the
entry <em>Compute gamma parameters</em>. This oppens a dialog which
shows the results of the computation for all three color channels. The
results may be saved to a file or may be applied to the current coor
device by pressing the respective button of this dialog.
