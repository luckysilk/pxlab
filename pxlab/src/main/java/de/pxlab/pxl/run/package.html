<p>Tools for running experiments both as applications or as applets.

<p>The class <code>ExRun</code> creates a panel with action buttons
for starting and stopping experiments. The panel may be added to a
frame which controls the panel. Experiments may either be run within
the given frame or may be run full screen. The panel created by
<code>ExRun</code> may also be controlled by an applet.

<p>The class <code>ExRunCommand</code> is a command line driven
controller which may be used to start experiments from within batch
files. It accepts several command line options including option -j
which can be used to create a java source file froman experimental
design. Such a design file may be compiled and can itself be run as an
application.

<h4>The ExRun class</h4>

<p>The ExRun class exposes the following methods to the public:

<ul>
<li> <code>public ExRun(ExRunController ctrl)</code> is the constructor of the
class.

<li>    <code>public void setDisplayPanel(DisplayPanel dp)</code>,
    <code>public void removeDisplayPanel()</code>,
    <code>public DisplayPanel getDisplayPanel()</code>,
    <code>public void open()</code>,
    <code>public void close()</code> are the DisplayPanelContainer
    implementation.

<li>
    <code>public Frame getFrame()</code>, 
    <code>public void stopSession()</code>
    are the DisplayPanelController implementation.

<li> 
    <code>public void setExDesign(ExDesign exd)</code> overrides the
    respective declaration in PXLabApplicationPanel.

<li> <code>public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e)</code>
implements the action bar's action listener.

<li>
    <code>public void experimentFinished()</code> is the
    ExDesignThreadStarter implementation.


</ul>






<h4>Running an Experiment</h4>

<P>To start an experiment we need an ExDesign object with a valid
design tree. The ExDesign's RuntimeContext must be
valid. EditableExDesign objects create a valid RuntimeContext on
instantiation. General ExDesign objects need an explicit
RuntimeContext validation. The ExRun application does that whenever a
new ExDesign is set:
<pre>
    public void setExDesign(ExDesign exd) {
	exDesign = exd;
	exDesign.validateRuntimeContext();
    }
</pre>
<p>An ExDesign object needs two objects to run an experimental session:

<ol><li> an ExDesignProcessor for running the display lists and

<li> a DataWriter to consume the data.
</ol>

<p>The ExDesign object does not execute the session, block, or trial
display lists by itself. It simply sends the respective design nodes
and display lists to the ExDesignProcessor which executes them. This
makes it possible to use different kinds of ExDesignProcessors. The
ProtocolExDesignProcessor does not show any displays but only prints a
protocol of the design nodes. The DefaultExDesignProcessor runs
displays on a screen. A SimulationExDesignProcessor can simulate
subject responses. 

<p>To create a DefaultExDesignProcessor we need a
DisplayPanelContainer with a RealTimeDisplayPanel. Here is how these
may be instantiated:
<pre>
   fullScreenWindow = new FullScreenDisplayPanelContainer(this);
   fullScreenWindow.setDisplayPanel(new RealTimeDisplayPanel());
</pre>
Having a DisplayPanelContainer we can instantiate a
DefaultExDesignProcessor, a DataWriter and tell the ExDesign object to
start the experiment:
<pre>
   exDesign.runExperiment(this, 
      new DefaultExDesignProcessor(fullScreenWindow, 
      new NoDataWriter());
</pre>
In this case we use the NoDataWriter subclass of DataWriter. This
DataWriter throws away all data. Other subclasses of DataWriter can
write the data to a text file (TextFileDataWriter) or send the data
to a given URL (URLDataWriter). The first argument to runExperiment() is
the ExDesignThreadStarter object which started the experiment. A
reference to this object is needed by the session running thread in
order to signal when the session has been finished.

<p>When an ExDesign object gets a runExperiment() message then it does
not directly send any messages to the ExDesignProcessor. The ExDesign
object first creates a new thread whose only task it is to run the
session. The reason why it is necessary to execute the experiment in
its own thread is this: The runExperiment() message of an ExDesign
will usually be executed from within the event handling thread. This
is because it will be the result of some button being
pressed. However, most experiments will collect subject responses and
will go into wait states to wait for these responses. Waiting is done
by suspending the executing thread. If the running thread is the event
handling thread and this thread is suspended then no events are
handled and the program will never get any response event. Thus the
ExDesign creates a thread and starts it:
<pre>
   ExRunThread exRunThread = new ExRunThread("ExDesignRun", threadStarter);
   exRunThread.start();
</pre>
The ExRunThread class remembers the starter and has a very simple run() method:
<pre>
   public void run() {
      runSession();
      threadStarter.experimentFinished();
   }
</pre>
It calls the ExDesign's runSession() method and runs the session. When
the session is finished it sends the thread starter object a
experimentFinished() message.
