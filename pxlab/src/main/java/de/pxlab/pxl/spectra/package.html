<p>Support for spectral distributions which are used to describe
light and remittance spectra. 

<p>The package also contains some data files containing often used
spectra, like the Munsell Book of Colors or some standard daylight
distributions.

<p>A <class>SpectralDistribution</class> describes a spectral
distribution of light or a spectral transmittance or remittance
function. Usually spectral distributions are identified by their name.
The package contains a data base of known spectra including CIE
daylight distributions and light sources and the Munsell book of
colors. Spectral operations supported by this class include spectral
multiplication (filtering), addition of spectra (additive mixture),
and conversion into tristimulus coordinates using standard CIE color
matching functions.

<p>The classes SpectralLightSource and SpectralLightFilter are derived
from SpectralDistribution. A spectral light source has a spectral
distribution function and a luminance. The luminance is that luminance
which would result from a perfect white reflector illuminated by this
light source. The light source also contains experimental parameters
for the name of the spectral distribution and the luminance
value. Both of these implement the interface LightEmitter which
describes objects which can have listeners to changes of spectral
distributions. Both SpectralLightSource and SpectralLightFilter
objects are used to build objects of class
FilteredSpectralLight. Every object of this class has a light source
and possibly multiple layers of SpectralLightFilters. The light
emitted by a FilteredSpectral Light object can be used to determine
CIE chromaticity coordinates. 

<p>The package also contains classes which may be used to display
spectral distribution charts on the screen and even modify these
charts using the mouse. A SpectralDistributionPanel can hold multiple
SpectralDistributionChart objects and these are able to listen to
changes of the attached spectra and display these.
